This small script can be opened and run with a program called GlovePIE (available at http://glovepie.org/glovepie_download.php)

When running with an xbox360 controller connected to your Windows PC, this will send certain hotkeys to VLC when the xbox controller is used eg. Pressing 'start' on the controller will send 'space' to VLC which will pause/play media.

Begginer instructions:

1. Download the newest version of GlovePIE from http://glovepie.org/glovepie_download.php

2. Extract .ZIP into C:\Program Files\

> 3. Download the CustomScripts.zip file available to the left of this text

> 4. Extract .ZIP into C:\Program Files\GlovePIE.

> 5. Run and then move GlovePIE shortcut from C:\Program Files\GlovePIE\CustomScripts to Start Menu\Startup. Skip to step 9


5. Alternatively skip steps 3 - 5 and download the xbox360VLCremote.PIE file

6. Save this file in C:\Program File\GlovePIE

7. Open GlovePIE then navigate to File>Open and find the .PIE file you just downloaded

8. Click Run

9. Open VLC and turn on your controller to start using the script

Note: For Linux/Ubuntu users there is a default driver that allows the wireless adapter to work in games without any installation. If you wish to setup a similar VLC control system you can go to <a href='http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/'>http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/</a> for an alternate driver where you can assign controller inputs to any keyboard or mouse events as you wish.<br>
